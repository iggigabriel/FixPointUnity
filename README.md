A fast multi-precision fixed-point library for Unity!

## Docs

This is a fork of [https://github.com/XMunkki/FixPointCS](https://github.com/XMunkki/FixPointCS) (v0.3) and all credit goes to original devs. You can read about the library features there. 

I added:

- package definition file so you can add it in UnityPackageManager by referencing this git URL: `https://github.com/iggigabriel/FixPointUnity.git`
- Unity inspector property drawers for FP32, FP32Vec2, FP32Vec3, FP32Vec4 and FP64, FP64Vec2, FP64Vec3, FP64Vec4 types
